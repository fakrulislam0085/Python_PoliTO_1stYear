## üîç Repository Structure

### **1. Lectures**
The lecture materials cover theoretical concepts and practical Python implementations introduced during the course. Each folder corresponds to a lecture, with codes written during the session.

- **Lecture 1:** Introduction to Programming   
- **Lecture 2:** Numbers and Strings
- **Lecture 3:** Decisions
- **Lecture 4:** Loops
- **Lecture 5:** Functions
- **Lecture 6:** T1-Data (Theory Part)
- **Lecture 7:** Lists and Tables
- **Lecture 8:** T2-Computer Architecture(Theory Part)
- **Lecture 9:** Files
- **Lecture 10:** Complex Data Structures

You can find all lecture codes in the `Lectures` folder.
