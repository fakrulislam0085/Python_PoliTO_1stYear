# Exercise 02.2.4
# Popular emojis

# Let's say that my most popular emoji are the following:
" üëç üôÇ üò≤ "

# To get the Unicode value you can use the ord() function
# ord('üëç') --> 128077
# In Unicode tables usually the expressed value is in base 16
# which can be received through hex()
# hex(128077) --> '0x1f44d'
# or directly: hex(ord('üëç')) --> '0x1f44d'

emoji1 = 'üëç'
rank1 = 4 # from https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/
unicode1 = '1F44D' # from https://unicode-table.com/en/1F44D/
name1 = 'Thumbs Up Sign'

emoji2 = 'üôÇ'
rank2 = 28 # from https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/
unicode2 = '1F642' # from https://unicode-table.com/en/1F642/
name2 = 'Slightly Smiling Face'

emoji3 = 'üò≤'
rank3 = 111 # from https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/
unicode3 = '1F632' # from https://unicode-table.com/en/1F632/
name3 = 'Astonished Face'
